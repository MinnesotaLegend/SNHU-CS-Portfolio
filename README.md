# SNHU-CS-Portfolio
Portfolio for SNHU Computer Science coursework

This repository contains coursework and projects completed as part of the CS-250 Software development Lifecycle course at Southern New Hampshire University.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a portfolio of my work demonstrating Agile and Scrum concepts, SDLC stages, and software development best practices.

1. Interpreting User Nees anad User Stories
I interpret user needs by working closely with stakeholders and translating their requirements into clear user stories. User stories help break down complex requirements into managebale pieces that focus on the user's perspective, which makes development more orgnaized and ensures the final product meets user expectations.

2. My Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Practices
I approach program development iteratively, focusing on incremental improvements through Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. In my future work, I hope to contiune using Agile methodologies to remain flexible, adapt to changing requirements, and deliver value consistently.

3. Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating effectively, and being accountable for assigned tasks. It also involves being open to feedback, supporting teamemates, and contributing positively to team goals to ensure successful project outcomes.
